# Google Foobar

My solutions for [Google Foobar](https://foobar.withgoogle.com/) secret coding challenge.

## Development

The project uses [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language for the solutions, so it's needed to be installed first. To make sure it's installed, run:

```sh
python --version
```

Then, install Python dependencies of the project:

```sh
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run tests:

```sh
pytest
```
